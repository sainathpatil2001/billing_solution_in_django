# Assets Folder

This folder contains application icons and other assets for the Electron desktop app.

## Required Files

- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (256x256 pixels)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (multiple sizes)
- `icon.png` - Linux icon (512x512 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons from a single high-resolution PNG image (512x512 or larger) using online tools like:

- [ConvertICO](https://converticon.com/)
- [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/)
- [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

## Placeholder

For now, you can use any PNG image as a placeholder. The app will work without custom icons, but it's recommended to create proper icons for a professional look.
